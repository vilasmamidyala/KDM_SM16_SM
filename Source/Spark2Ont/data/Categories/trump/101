Trump graduated from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Having worked in his father Fred Trump's real estate and construction firm while attending college, he assumed control of the business in 1973, later renaming it The Trump Organization. During his career, Trump has built hotels, casinos, golf courses, the Manhattan neighborhood Riverside South, and numerous other developments, many of which bear his name, including Trump Entertainment Resorts (now owned by Carl Icahn). He briefly sought the Reform Party's nomination in the 2000 presidential election, withdrawing prior to any primary contests, although he won two primaries after his withdrawal. Listed by Forbes among the wealthiest 400 of The World's Billionaires, Trump and his businesses, as well as his three marriages, have for decades received prominent media exposure.
