Early life
Hillary[nb 2] Diane Rodham was born on October 26, 1947, at Edgewater Hospital in Chicago, Illinois.[2][3] She was raised in a United Methodist family, first in Chicago and then, from the age of three, in suburban Park Ridge, Illinois.[4] She is a lifelong United Methodist. Her father, Hugh Ellsworth Rodham (1911–1993), was of Welsh and English descent;[5] he managed a successful small business in the textile industry.[6] Her mother, Dorothy Emma Howell (1919–2011), was a homemaker of English, Scottish, French Canadian, and Welsh descent.[5][7][8] Hillary has two younger brothers, Hugh and Tony.[9]

As a child, Rodham was a favorite of her teachers at the public schools she attended in Park Ridge.[10][11] She participated in sports, such as swimming and baseball, and earned numerous badges as a Brownie and as a Girl Scout.[10][11] She has often told a story of being inspired by U.S. efforts during the Space Race and sending a letter to NASA around 1961 asking what she could do to become an astronaut, only to be told that no women were being accepted into that program.[12]

She attended Maine East High School, where she participated in student council, the school newspaper, and was selected for National Honor Society.[2][13] She won election as class vice president for her junior year, but then lost an election for class president for her senior year against two boys, one of whom told her that "you are really stupid if you think a girl can be elected president."[14] For her senior year, she was redistricted to Maine South High School, where she was a National Merit Finalist and graduated in the top five percent of her class of 1965.[13][15] Rodham's mother wanted her to have an independent, professional career,[8] and her father, otherwise a traditionalist, felt that his daughter's abilities and opportunities should not be limited by gender.[16]

Raised in a politically conservative household,[8] Rodham helped canvass Chicago's South Side at age thirteen following the very close 1960 U.S. presidential election, where she saw evidence of electoral fraud (such as voting list entries showing addresses that were empty lots) against Republican candidate Richard Nixon.[17] She then volunteered to campaign for Republican candidate Barry Goldwater in the U.S. presidential election of 1964.[18] Rodham's early political development was shaped most by her high school history teacher (like her father, a fervent anti-communist), who introduced her to Goldwater's The Conscience of a Conservative, and by her Methodist youth minister (like her mother, concerned with issues of social justice), with whom she saw, and afterwards briefly met, civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. at a 1962 speech in Chicago's Orchestra Hall.[19]

Wellesley College years
In 1965, Rodham enrolled at Wellesley College, where she majored in political science.[20] During her freshman year, she served as president of the Wellesley Young Republicans;[21][22] with this Rockefeller Republican-oriented group,[23] she supported the elections to mayor of John Lindsay (New York City) and to U.S. senator of Edward Brooke (Massachusetts).[24] She later stepped down from this position, as her views changed regarding the American Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War.[21] In a letter to her youth minister at this time, she described herself as "a mind conservative and a heart liberal".[25] In contrast to the 1960s current that advocated radical actions against the political system, she sought to work for change within it.[26][27]

In her junior year, Rodham became a supporter of the antiwar presidential nomination campaign of Democrat Eugene McCarthy.[28] In early 1968, she was elected president of the Wellesley College Government Association and served through early 1969.[26][29] Following the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., Rodham organized a two-day student strike and worked with Wellesley's black students to recruit more black students and faculty.[28] In her student government role, she played a role in keeping Wellesley from being embroiled in the student disruptions common to other colleges.[26][30] A number of her fellow students thought she might some day become the first female President of the United States.[26]

To help her better understand her changing political views, Professor Alan Schechter assigned Rodham to intern at the House Republican Conference, and she attended the "Wellesley in Washington" summer program.[28] Rodham was invited by moderate New York Republican Representative Charles Goodell to help Governor Nelson Rockefeller's late-entry campaign for the Republican nomination.[28] Rodham attended the 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami. However, she was upset by the way Richard Nixon's campaign portrayed Rockefeller and by what she perceived as the convention's "veiled" racist messages, and left the Republican Party for good.[28] Rodham wrote her senior thesis, a critique of the tactics of radical community organizer Saul Alinsky, under Professor Schechter.[31] (Years later, while she was first lady, access to her thesis was restricted at the request of the White House and it became the subject of some speculation.[31])

In 1969, she graduated with a bachelor of arts,[32] with departmental honors in political science.[31] After some fellow seniors requested that the college administration allow a student speaker at commencement, she became the first student in Wellesley College history to speak at the event, following commencement speaker Senator Brooke.[29][33] Her speech received a standing ovation lasting seven minutes.[26][34][35] She was featured in an article published in Life magazine,[36] due to the response to a part of her speech that criticized Senator Brooke.[33] She also appeared on Irv Kupcinet's nationally syndicated television talk show as well as in Illinois and New England newspapers.[37] That summer, she worked her way across Alaska, washing dishes in Mount McKinley National Park and sliming salmon in a fish processing cannery in Valdez (which fired her and shut down overnight when she complained about unhealthful conditions).[38]
