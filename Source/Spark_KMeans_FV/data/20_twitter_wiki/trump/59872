rump Model Management
In 1999, Trump founded a modeling company, Trump Model Management, which operates in the SoHo neighborhood of New York City.[222] Together with another Trump company, Trump Management Group LLC, Trump Model Management has brought nearly 250 foreign fashion models into the U.S. to work in the fashion industry since 2000.[223] In 2014, president of Trump Model Management Corrine Nicolas, other managers, and the company were sued by one of the agency's former models, Alexia Palmer, alleging racketeering, breach of contract, mail fraud, and violating immigrant wage laws.[224] The case was dismissed from federal court in March 2016.[225]

World Wrestling Entertainment
Trump is a World Wrestling Entertainment fan and friend of WWE owner Vince McMahon. He has hosted two WrestleMania events in the Trump Plaza and has been an active participant in several of the shows.[226] Trump's Taj Mahal in Atlantic City was host to the 1991 WBF Championship (which was owned by WWE, known at the time as the "World Wrestling Federation"). He also appeared in WrestleMania VII. He was interviewed by Jesse Ventura ringside at WrestleMania XX.[227]

Trump appeared at WrestleMania 23 in a match called "The Battle of the Billionaires."[226] He was in the corner of Bobby Lashley, while Vince McMahon was in the corner of Lashley's opponent Umaga with Stone Cold Steve Austin as the special guest referee.[226] The deal was that either Trump or McMahon would have their head shaved if their competitor lost.[226] Lashley won the match, and so McMahon got the haircut.[226]

On June 15, 2009, as part of a storyline, McMahon announced on Monday Night Raw that he had "sold" the show to Trump.[226] Appearing on screen, Trump declared he would be at the following commercial-free episode in person and would give a full refund to the people who purchased tickets to the arena for that night's show.[226] McMahon "bought back" Raw the following week for twice the price.[226]

Trump was inducted into the celebrity wing of the WWE Hall of Fame in 2013, at Madison Square Garden for his contributions to the promotion. He made his sixth WrestleMania appearance the next night.[228]

Politics
Trump has described his political leanings and positions in various ways over time.[229][230][231] Politico has described his positions as "eclectic, improvisational and often contradictory".[231] He has listed several different party affiliations over the years,[231][232] and has also run as a Reform Party candidate.[232] The positions that he has revised or reversed include stances on progressive taxation, abortion, and government involvement in health care.[231]

Political affiliations

With President Ronald Reagan at White House reception in 1987
Trump's party affiliation has changed over the years. Although his party affiliation prior to 1987 is unclear, Trump was an early supporter of Republican Ronald Reagan for U.S. President in the late 70s.[233] In 1987 he registered as a Republican until 1999. He then switched to the Reform Party for three years and ran a presidential exploratory campaign for its nomination. After his run, Trump left the party in 2001 due to the involvement of David Duke, Pat Buchanan and Lenora Fulani within the party.[234] From 2001 to 2009 he was a Democrat and then switched back to the Republican Party in 2009 after endorsing Republican John McCain for President.[235] In December 2011, Trump became an Independent for five months, before returning to the Republican Party, where he has pledged to stay.[236][237]

Trump has made contributions to campaigns of both Republican Party and Democratic Party candidates, with the top ten recipients of his political contributions being six Democrats and four Republicans.[238] After 2011, his campaign contributions were more favorable to Republicans than to Democrats.[239] In February 2012, Trump endorsed Republican Mitt Romney for President.[240] When asked in 2015 which recent President he prefers, Trump picked Democrat Bill Clinton over the Republican Bushes.[241][242]

Involvement in politics, 1988–2015
See also: Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2000
Trump floated the idea of running for president in 1988, 2004, and 2012, and for Governor of New York in 2006 and 2014, but did not enter those races.[243][244] He was considered as a potential running mate for George H. W. Bush on the Republican Party's 1988 presidential ticket but lost out to future Vice President Dan Quayle. There is dispute over whether Trump or the Bush camp made the initial pitch.[245]

In 1999, Trump filed an exploratory committee to seek the presidential nomination of the Reform Party in 2000.[246][247] A July 1999 poll matching him against likely Republican nominee George W. Bush and likely Democratic nominee Al Gore showed Trump with seven percent support.[248] Though he dropped out of the race due to party infighting, Trump still won the party's California and Michigan primaries after dropping out.[249][250][251][252]

In February 2009, Trump appeared on The Late Show with David Letterman, and spoke about the automotive industry crisis of 2008–10. He said that "instead of asking for money", General Motors "should go into bankruptcy and work that stuff out in a deal".[253]


Trump first expressed interest in running for office in 1987, when he spent $100,000 to place full page ads critiquing U.S. defense policy in The Boston Globe, The New York Times, and The Washington Post.[254][255]
As Trump publicly speculated about seeking the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released in March 2011 found Trump leading among potential contenders, one point ahead of former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney.[256] A Newsweek poll conducted in February 2011 showed Trump within a few points of Barack Obama, with many voters undecided in the November 2012 general election for president of the United States.[257] A poll released in April 2011 by Public Policy Polling showed Trump having a nine-point lead in a potential contest for the Republican nomination for president while he was still actively considering a run.[258][259] His moves were interpreted by some media as possible promotional tools for his reality show The Apprentice.[260][261][262]

In April 2011, Trump waded into the controversy about President Barack Obama's proof of eligibility as a natural born citizen: "His grandmother in Kenya said he was born in Kenya and she was there and witnessed the birth, okay?"[263][264][265] Trump's claim was based upon an incomplete transcript filed years earlier in a court case.[264][266][267] Trump also questioned whether Obama's grades alone warranted entry to his Ivy League schools, and called for release of school records,[268] plus release of a long form birth certificate.[269][270] Two days later, the White House sought to put the longstanding matter to rest with release of the long form.[271] Trump said he hoped it "checks out", and expressed pride about his role.[272] When asked years later where Obama was born, Trump said: "I really don't know. I mean, I don't know why he wouldn't release his records. But you know, honestly, I don't want to get into it".[273][274]

Trump’s strengths as a potential candidate in the 2012 presidential election included being a businessman, not being a politician, not talking like a politician, and not thinking like a politician.[275] He generally had polled at or below 17 percent among the crowded field of possible Republican candidates.[275] On May 16, 2011, Trump announced he would not run for president in the 2012 election, while also saying he would have won.[260]


Trump after speaking at Conservative Political Action Conference in February 2011
In 2013, Trump was a featured speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC).[276] During the lightly-attended early-morning speech, Trump said that President Obama gets "unprecedented media protection", he spoke against illegal immigration, and advised against harming Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.[277][278]

Also in 2013, he spent over $1 million to research a possible run for president of the United States.[279] In October 2013, New York Republicans circulated a memo suggesting Trump should run for governor of the state in 2014, against Andrew Cuomo; Trump said in response that while New York had problems and taxes were too high, running for governor was not of great interest to him.[280] He also made statements denying climate change that were discordant with the opinion of the scientific community.[281] In February 2015, Trump opted not to renew his television contract for The Apprentice, generating speculation that he might run for president in 2016.[282]

Presidential campaign, 2016

Trump campaigning in Fountain Hills, Arizona, March 2016
On June 16, 2015, Trump announced his candidacy for President of the United States at Trump Tower in New York City. Trump drew attention to domestic issues such as illegal immigration, offshoring of American jobs, the U.S. national debt, and Islamic terrorism, and announced his campaign slogan, "Make America Great Again."[283] Trump ran as a self-described conservative, particularly in fiscal and religious matters. His campaign emphasises American patriotism, with disdain for political correctness.[284][285][286]

In the primary election, the Republican establishment widely opposed Trump's candidacy, doubting his chances of winning the general election and fearing he could cause significant harm to the image of the Republican Party.[287] During the primaries, political contenders described him as "divisive", "unserious", and a "bully", denouncing the personal attacks he makes on journalists, politicians, and competing candidates.[288][289][290] However, Trump's candidacy succeeded with Republican primary voters, partly because of widespread media coverage, his ability to largely self-finance his campaign without reliance on super PACs, frequent endorsements, and the perception that he "tells it like it is".[291][292] As of June 2016, about 4% of his campaign was funded by super PACs.[293]

Trump has generally employed strong rhetoric.[294] He has supported Christian groups in the U.S., claiming that he will reverse unfavorable tax treatments preventing them from expressing themselves in the political arena and promising to revive a more widespread use of the phrase "Merry Christmas" instead of "Happy Holidays" in department stores. Other issues he highlights include taking care of military veterans, making the military "strong", aggressive bombing of the Mideast terrorist group ISIS, surveillance of certain mosques in the U.S., and making trade agreements more favorable to American workers.[295][296][297]

Primaries
Main article: Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016
Trump entered a large field of candidates consisting of 16 other Republican candidates campaigning for the nomination, the largest presidential field in American history.[298] By early 2016, the race had mostly centered on Donald Trump and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz.[299] On Super Tuesday, Trump won the majority of the delegates and remained the front-runner throughout the primaries. By March 2016, Trump reached over 50% in national support from Republican primary voters and became poised to win the Republican nomination.[300] After a landslide win in Indiana on May 3, 2016, which prompted the remaining candidates Ted Cruz and John Kasich to suspend their presidential campaigns, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus declared Trump the presumptive nominee. Finishing in June 2016 with nearly 14 million votes, Trump broke the all-time record for winning the most primary votes in the history of the Republican Party.[304]

General election
Main article: United States presidential election, 2016
After becoming the presumptive Republican nominee, Trump's focus shifted to the general election, urging remaining primary voters to "save their vote for the general election."[305] Trump began targeting Hillary Clinton, who became the presumptive Democratic nominee on June 6, 2016, and continued to campaign across the country under police protection. One month before the Republican National Convention, Secret Service agents thwarted an assassination attempt on Trump by a 20-year-old man illegally residing in the U.S. during one of his rallies in Las Vegas.[309]

Political positions
Main article: Political positions of Donald Trump
Trump has described his political positions in various and often contradictory ways over time.[229][231][310] Politifact writes that it is difficult to determine Trump's stance on issues, given his frequent changes in position and "his penchant for using confusing, vague and even contradictory language."[311] Politico has described his positions as "eclectic, improvisational and often contradictory."[231] Trump's political positions are widely described by the media as "populist".[312][313]

Social issues
Some political analysts describe Trump as a "moderate" regarding LGBT rights and abortion.[317] Trump describes himself as pro-life and would ban late-term abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or health.[318] He is in favor of cutting federal funding for Planned Parenthood.[319] Trump supports the Second Amendment and is opposed to gun control in general.[320] He supports fixing the federal background check system so that criminal and mental health records are always put into the system.[321] Trump opposes legalizing recreational marijuana but supports legalizing medical marijuana.[322]

Trump has stated that he supports "traditional marriage".[323] He has described himself as a "friend" of the LGBT community and has not committed to reversing the June 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide.[326] Regarding the ruling, he said: "I would have preferred states, you know, making the decision and I let that be known. But they made the decision. [...] So, at a certain point you have to be realistic about it."[318][324] Trump has demonstrated his support of capital punishment both through his campaign speeches about killings of police officers,[327] and through full-page ads he purchased favoring capital punishment in New York during the 1989 Central Park jogger case.[328]

Healthcare and education
Trump favors replacing the Affordable Care Act (commonly referred to as "Obamacare") with a different free-market plan that would allow health insurance to be sold across state lines, enable individuals to deduct health insurance premiums, expand health savings accounts, and give more control of Medicaid to the states.[329] He has voiced support for a single-payer healthcare system in the past, but distanced himself from the idea during his 2016 campaign.[330] Trump favors getting rid of backlogs and waitlists which are the focus of the Veterans Health Administration scandal. In a statement, he said he believes that Veterans Affairs facilities need to be upgraded with recent technology, hire more veterans to treat other veterans, increase support of female veterans, and create satellite clinics within hospitals in rural areas.[331] Trump has stated his support for school choice and local control for primary and secondary schools.[332] He opposes the Common Core State Standards Initiative for primary and secondary schools,[318][333] and has called Common Core "a disaster" that must be ended.[334]

Trade
Trump identifies as a "free trader", but says that trade must be "reasonably fair".[335] He strongly opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).[336] His campaign's tax plan calls for reducing the corporate tax rate to 15% concurrent with the elimination of various loopholes and deductions.[337] During the Republican Party Primary, Trump said that the minimum wage should not be raised because increasing it would hurt America's economic competitiveness.[338] However, since becoming the presumptive nominee for Republican candidate for President he has stated that he is open to raising the minimum wage, saying: "I haven't decided in terms of numbers. But I think people have to get more."[339]

Foreign policy
Trump has been described as non-interventionalist[340][341] and nationalist.[342] He supports increasing U.S. military defense spending,[342] but favors decreasing U.S. spending on NATO.[343] Trump has at various times said he favored and opposed sending US ground forces to defeat the Islamic State.[229] He supports expanded use of aggressive interrogation techniques, including waterboarding "and a hell of a lot worse", with terrorists.[344][345]

Trump has called for Japan to pay for the costs of American troops stationed there and that it might need to develop nuclear weapons in order to protect itself from North Korea.[346][347]

Trump tentatively endorsed ("Yeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly.") a future invasion of Iraq in 2002. [348] There is no public record of him opposing the war until 2003, after it was well under way. By 2004 he was public in his criticism of the war. [349] In 2008, Trump said that George W. Bush should have been impeached for the invasion of Iraq.[350] In 2013, he repeatedly referred to the war as a "mess" and in December 2013 also said that "People are questioning invading Iraq in the first place".[351] On February 13 during Republican Presidential debates, Trump called the war "a big, fat mistake" and alleged that "They lied. They said there were weapons of mass destruction -- there were none. And they knew there were none." [352][353] He criticized the impact of the war on the region: "[W]e should have never been in Iraq, we have destabilized the Middle East."[353] On February 18, 2016, he said that by the time the invasion occurred, he had become an opponent.[354]

In terms of confronting ISIS, Trump called for sending 20,000 to 30,000 US troops to the region,[355][356] a position he retracted.[357] He has since argued that regional allies of the US, such as Saudi Arabia should provide troops in the fight.[358] He also believes that oil fields in ISIS-controlled areas should be bombed.[359]

Regarding the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, Trump has stated the importance of being a neutral party during potential negotiations, while also having stated that he is "a big fan of Israel."[360] He supports Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank.[361] Trump has been critical of Pakistan, comparing it to North Korea, describing it as "probably the most dangerous country" in the world, and saying that Pakistan's nuclear weapons posed a "serious problem." He has advocated improving relations with India as a "check" to Pakistan.[362]

Environmental issues
Trump has said that the EPA is a "disgrace" and has promised to cut its budget.[363] He has called global warming "a total hoax", claiming at one point that it was perpetrated by the Chinese to harm American businesses.[323][364]

Immigration policies

Trump has proposed strengthening the Mexico–U.S. barrier.
Trump's immigration policies have been among his most highly discussed policies during the campaign. While many of Trump's policies appeal to working-class voters, some have come under scrutiny by several experts on immigration who question the effectiveness and affordability of his plans.[365][366]

Trump has emphasized U.S. border security, but says that his specific proposals during the campaign are flexible suggestions. Trump vows to strengthen the Mexico–United States border by building a substantial wall in order to keep out illegal immigrants, a wall which Trump promises Mexico will pay for.[367][368] Trump would also create a "deportation force" to deport around 11 million people illegally residing in the U.S., stating "Day 1 of my presidency, [illegal immigrants] are getting out and getting out fast."[369] During Trump's campaign, U.S. naturalization applications spiked by 14 percent, creating speculation illegal immigrants are rushing to become U.S. citizens out of fear of being deported if Trump becomes President.[370] Trump also opposes birthright citizenship, arguing people born in the United States shouldn't automatically be granted U.S. citizenship.[371]

One of Trump's most controversial proposals was a temporary ban on foreign Muslims entering the United States.[376] This proposal by Trump came in response to a wave of radical Islamic terrorist attacks in Europe, with Trump stating that Belgium and France had been blighted by the failure of Muslims in these countries to integrate, and that living in Brussels was like living in a "hellhole" because of its dire state in Muslim assimilation.[377] The proposal came under heavy scrutiny, with critics saying such a ban would go against American values, or against the Constitution.[381] Trump later modified his position by stating that the temporary ban would apply to people originating from countries with a proven history of terrorism against the United States or its allies.[382] Trump has said that the ban would be lifted once the government has perfected its ability to screen out potential terrorists.[383]

Comments about fringe theories
According to political writer Steve Benen, unlike past political leaders, Trump has not kept fringe theories and their supporters at arm's length.[384] Political writer Jack Shafer says that Trump may be a "fairly conventional American populist when it comes to his policy views", but he has a revolutionary ability to attract free media attention, sometimes by making outrageous comments.[385][386]

Although Trump has refused to discuss his past comments on Obama's proof of citizenship during the campaign, he has not shied away from other topics that attract fringe theorists.[387] Among others, Trump has alluded to the theory that President Obama is secretly a Muslim,[388][389] the unfounded notion that vaccine doses cause autism if administered too quickly in succession,[390][391] and the conspiracy theory that former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia might not have died of natural causes but was murdered.[392]
