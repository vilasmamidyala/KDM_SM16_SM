2008 presidential campaign
Main article: Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2008
Clinton had been preparing for a potential candidacy for U.S. President since at least early 2003.[272] On January 20, 2007, she announced via her website the formation of a presidential exploratory committee for the United States presidential election of 2008, stating "I'm in, and I'm in to win."[273] No woman had ever been nominated by a major party for the presidency. When Bill Clinton became president in 1993, a blind trust was established; in April 2007, the Clintons liquidated the blind trust to avoid the possibility of ethical conflicts or political embarrassments as Hillary Clinton undertook her presidential race.[274] Later disclosure statements revealed that the couple's worth was now upwards of $50 million,[274] and that they had earned over $100 million since 2000, with most of it coming from Bill Clinton's books, speaking engagements, and other activities.[275]

Throughout the first half of 2007, Clinton led candidates competing for the Democratic presidential nomination in opinion polls for the election. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois and former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina were her strongest competitors.[243] The biggest threat to her campaign was her past support of the Iraq War, which Obama had opposed from the beginning.[243] Clinton and Obama both set records for early fundraising, swapping the money lead each quarter.[276]

By September 2007, polling in the first six states holding Democratic contests showed that Clinton was leading in all of them, with the races being closest in Iowa and South Carolina. By the following month, national polls showed Clinton far ahead of Democratic competitors.[277] At the end of October, Clinton suffered a rare poor debate performance against Obama, Edwards, and her other opponents.[278][279] Obama's message of change began to resonate with the Democratic electorate better than Clinton's message of experience.[280] The race tightened considerably, especially in the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, with Clinton losing her lead in some polls by December.[281]

In the first vote of 2008, she placed third in the January 3 Iowa Democratic caucus behind Obama and Edwards.[282] Obama gained ground in national polling in the next few days, with all polls predicting a victory for him in the New Hampshire primary.[283] Clinton gained a surprise win there on January 8, defeating Obama narrowly.[284] It was the first time a woman had won a major American party's presidential primary for the purposes of delegate selection.[285] Explanations for Clinton's New Hampshire comeback varied but often centered on her being seen more sympathetically, especially by women, after her eyes welled with tears and her voice broke while responding to a voter's question the day before the election.[286]

The nature of the contest fractured in the next few days. Several remarks by Bill Clinton and other surrogates,[287] and a remark by Hillary Clinton concerning Martin Luther King, Jr. and Lyndon B. Johnson,[nb 10] were perceived by many as, accidentally or intentionally, limiting Obama as a racially oriented candidate or otherwise denying the post-racial significance and accomplishments of his campaign.[288] Despite attempts by both Hillary Clinton and Obama to downplay the issue, Democratic voting became more polarized as a result, with Clinton losing much of her support among African Americans.[287][289] She lost by a two-to-one margin to Obama in the January 26 South Carolina primary,[289] setting up, with Edwards soon dropping out, an intense two-person contest for the twenty-two February 5 Super Tuesday states. Bill Clinton had made more statements attracting criticism for their perceived racial implications late in the South Carolina campaign, and his role was seen as damaging enough to her that a wave of supporters within and outside of the campaign said the former President "needs to stop".[290] The South Carolina campaign had done lasting damage to Clinton, eroding her support among the Democratic establishment and leading to the prized endorsement of Obama by Ted Kennedy.[291]

On Super Tuesday, Clinton won the largest states, such as California, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts, while Obama won more states;[292] they almost evenly split the total popular vote.[293] But Obama was gaining more pledged delegates for his share of the popular vote due to better exploitation of the Democratic proportional allocation rules.[294]

The Clinton campaign had counted on winning the nomination by Super Tuesday and was unprepared financially and logistically for a prolonged effort; lagging in Internet fundraising, Clinton began loaning money to her campaign.[280][295] There was continuous turmoil within the campaign staff and she made several top-level personnel changes.[295][296] Obama won the next eleven February contests across the country, often by large margins, and took a significant pledged delegate lead over Clinton.[294][295] On March 4, Clinton broke the string of losses by winning in Ohio among other places,[295] where her criticism of NAFTA, a major legacy of her husband's presidency, helped in a state where the trade agreement was unpopular.[297] Throughout the campaign, Obama dominated caucuses, for which the Clinton campaign largely ignored preparation.[280][294] Obama did well in primaries where African Americans or younger, college-educated, or more affluent voters were heavily represented; Clinton did well in primaries where Hispanics or older, non-college-educated, or working-class white voters predominated.[298][299] Behind in delegates, Clinton's best hope of winning the nomination came in persuading uncommitted, party-appointed superdelegates.[300]

Clinton's admission in late March, that her repeated campaign statements about having been under hostile fire from snipers during a March 1996 visit to U.S. troops at Tuzla Air Base in Bosnia and Herzegovina were not true, attracted considerable media attention.[301] On April 22, she won the Pennsylvania primary and kept her campaign alive.[302] On May 6, a narrower-than-expected win in the Indiana primary, coupled with a large loss in the North Carolina primary, ended any realistic chance she had of winning the nomination.[302] She vowed to stay on through the remaining primaries, but stopped attacks against Obama; as one advisor stated, "She could accept losing. She could not accept quitting."[302] She won some of the remaining contests, and indeed over the last three months of the campaign won more delegates, states, and votes than Obama, but she failed to overcome Obama's lead.[295]

Following the final primaries on June 3, 2008, Obama had gained enough delegates to become the presumptive nominee.[303] In a speech before her supporters on June 7, Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama.[304] By campaign's end, Clinton had won 1,640 pledged delegates to Obama's 1,763;[305] at the time of the clinching, Clinton had 286 superdelegates to Obama's 395,[306] with those numbers widening to 256 versus 438 once Obama was acknowledged the winner.[305] Clinton and Obama each received over 17 million votes during the nomination process[nb 11] with both breaking the previous record.[307] Clinton was the first woman to run in the primary or caucus of every state, and she eclipsed, by a very wide margin, Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm's 1972 marks for most votes garnered and delegates won by a woman.[285] Clinton gave a passionate speech supporting Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention and campaigned frequently for him in Fall 2008, which concluded with his victory over McCain in the general election on November 4.[308] Clinton's campaign ended up severely in debt; she owed millions of dollars to outside vendors and wrote off the $13 million that she lent it herself.[309] The debt was eventually paid off by the beginning of 2013.[309]

In mid-November 2008, President-elect Obama and Clinton discussed the possibility of her serving as U.S. Secretary of State in his administration.[310] She was initially quite reluctant, but on November 20, she told Obama she would accept the position.[311][312] On December 1, President-elect Obama formally announced that Clinton would be his nominee for Secretary of State.[313] Clinton said she did not want to leave the Senate, but that the new position represented a "difficult and exciting adventure".[313] As part of the nomination and in order to relieve concerns of conflict of interest, Bill Clinton agreed to accept several conditions and restrictions regarding his ongoing activities and fundraising efforts for the William J. Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative.[314]

The appointment required a Saxbe fix, passed and signed into law in December 2008.[315] Confirmation hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee began on January 13, 2009, a week before the Obama inauguration; two days later, the Committee voted 16â€“1 to approve Clinton.[316] By this time, her public approval rating had reached 65 percent, the highest point since the Lewinsky scandal.[317] On January 21, 2009, Clinton was confirmed in the full Senate by a vote of 94â€“2.[318] Clinton took the oath of office of Secretary of State and resigned from the Senate that same day.[319] She became the first former first lady to serve in the United States Cabinet.[320]

First half of tenure

Clinton spent her initial days as Secretary of State telephoning dozens of world leaders and indicating that U.S. foreign policy would change direction: "We have a lot of damage to repair."[321] She advocated an expanded role in global economic issues for the State Department and cited the need for an increased U.S. diplomatic presence, especially in Iraq where the Defense Department had conducted diplomatic missions.[322] Clinton announced the most ambitious of her departmental reforms, the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review, which establishes specific objectives for the State Department's diplomatic missions abroad; it was modeled after a similar process in the Defense Department that she was familiar with from her time on the Senate Armed Services Committee.[323] The first such review was issued in late 2010 and called for the U.S. leading through "civilian power" as a cost-effective way of responding to international challenges and defusing crises.[324] It also sought to institutionalize goals of empowering women throughout the world.[181] A cause Clinton advocated throughout her tenure was the adoption of cookstoves in the developing world, to foster cleaner and more environmentally sound food preparation and reduce smoke dangers to women.[311]

Clinton with Sergey Lavrov and the reset button

In an internal debate regarding the war in Afghanistan during 2009, Clinton sided with the military's recommendations for a maximal "Afghanistan surge", recommending 40,000 troops and no public deadline for withdrawal; she prevailed over Vice President Joe Biden's opposition, but eventually supported Obama's compromise plan to send an additional 30,000 troops and tie the surge to a timetable for eventual withdrawal.[249][325] In March 2009, Clinton presented Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov with a "reset button" symbolizing U.S. attempts to rebuild ties with that country under its new president, Dmitry Medvedev.[326][327] The photo op was remembered for a mistranslation into Russian. The policy, which became known as the Russian reset, led to improved cooperation in several areas during Medvedev's time in office, but relations would worsen considerably following Vladimir Putin's return to the position in 2012.[326] In October 2009, on a trip to Switzerland, Clinton's intervention overcame last-minute snags and saved the signing of an historic Turkishâ€“Armenian accord that established diplomatic relations and opened the border between the two long-hostile nations.[328][329] In Pakistan, she engaged in several unusually blunt discussions with students, talk show hosts, and tribal elders, in an attempt to repair the Pakistani image of the U.S.[179][nb 12] Beginning in 2010, she helped organize a diplomatic isolation and international sanctions regime against Iran, in an effort to force curtailment of that country's nuclear program; this would eventually lead to the multinational Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action being agreed to in 2015.[311][331][332]

Clinton and Obama forged a good working relationship without power struggles; she was a team player within the administration and a defender of it to the outside, and was careful that neither she nor her husband would upstage the president.[333][334] Clinton formed an alliance with Secretary of Defense Gates as they shared similar strategic outlooks.[335] Obama and Clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely non-ideological, pragmatic exercise.[311] She met with him weekly but did not have the close, daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents;[334] moreover, certain key areas of policymaking were kept inside the White House or Pentagon.[336][337] Nevertheless, the president had trust in her actions.[311]

In a prepared speech in January 2010, Clinton drew analogies between the Iron Curtain and the free and unfree Internet.[338] Chinese officials reacted negatively towards it and the speech garnered attention as the first time a senior American official had clearly defined the Internet as a key element of American foreign policy.[339] In July 2010, Secretary Clinton visited Korea, Vietnam, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, all the while preparing for the July 31 wedding of daughter Chelsea amid much media attention.[340] In late November 2010, Clinton led the U.S. damage control effort after WikiLeaks released confidential State Department cables containing blunt statements and assessments by U.S. and foreign diplomats.[341]

Second half of tenure
The 2011 Egyptian protests posed the most challenging foreign policy crisis for the administration yet.[342] Clinton's public response quickly evolved from an early assessment that the government of Hosni Mubarak was "stable", to a stance that there needed to be an "orderly transition [to] a democratic participatory government", to a condemnation of violence against the protesters.[343][344] Obama came to rely upon Clinton's advice, organization, and personal connections in the behind-the-scenes response to developments.[342] As Arab Spring protests spread throughout the region, Clinton was at the forefront of a U.S. response that she recognized was sometimes contradictory, backing some regimes while supporting protesters against others.[345]


The London meeting to discuss NATO military intervention in Libya, 29 March 2011
As the Libyan Civil War took place, Clinton's shift in favor of military intervention aligned her with Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice and National Security Council figure Samantha Power and was a key turning point in overcoming internal administration opposition from Defense Secretary Gates, security advisor Thomas E. Donilon, and counterterrorism advisor John Brennan in gaining the backing for, and Arab and U.N. approval of, the 2011 military intervention in Libya.[345][346][347] Secretary Clinton testified to Congress that the administration did not need congressional authorization for its military intervention in Libya, despite objections from some members of both parties that the administration was violating the War Powers Resolution, and the State Department's legal advisor argued the same when the Resolution's 60-day limit for unauthorized wars was passed (a view that prevailed in a legal debate within the Obama administration).[348] Clinton later used U.S. allies and what she called "convening power" to promote unity among the Libyan rebels as they eventually overthrew the Gaddafi regime.[346] The aftermath of the Libyan Civil War saw the country becoming a failed state,[349] and the wisdom of the intervention and interpretation of what happened afterward would become the subject of considerable debate.[350][351][352]

During April 2011 internal deliberations of the president's innermost circle of advisors over whether to order U.S. special forces to conduct a raid into Pakistan against Osama bin Laden, Clinton was among those who argued in favor, saying the importance of getting bin Laden outweighed the risks to the U.S. relationship with Pakistan.[353][354] Following completion of the mission on May 2, which resulted in bin Laden's death, Clinton played a key role in the administration's decision not to release photographs of the dead al-Qaeda leader.[355] During internal discussions regarding Iraq in 2011, Clinton argued for keeping a residual force of up to 10,000â€“20,000 U.S. troops there (all ended up being withdrawn after negotiations for a revised U.S.â€“Iraq Status of Forces Agreement failed).[249][356]

In a speech before the United Nations Human Rights Council in December 2011, Clinton said that "Gay rights are human rights", and that the U.S. would advocate for gay rights and legal protections of gays abroad.[357] The same period saw her overcome internal administration opposition with a direct appeal to Obama and stage the first visit to Burma by a U.S. secretary of state since 1955, as she met with Burmese leaders as well as opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and sought to support the 2011 Burmese democratic reforms.[358][359] She also said that the 21st century would be "America's Pacific century",[360] a declaration that was part of the Obama administration's "pivot to Asia".[361]

During the Syrian Civil War, Clinton and the Obama administration initially sought to persuade Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to engage popular demonstrations with reform, then as government violence rose in August 2011, called for him to relinquish power.[362] The administration joined a number of allied countries in delivering non-lethal assistance to rebels opposed to the Assad government, as well as to humanitarian groups working in Syria.[363] During mid-2012, Clinton formed a plan with CIA Director David Petraeus to further strengthen the opposition by arming and training vetted groups of Syrian rebels, but the proposal was rejected by the White House, who were reluctant to become entangled in the conflict and who feared that extremists hidden among the rebels might turn the weapons against other targets.[358][364]

In December 2012, Clinton was hospitalized for a few days for treatment of a blood clot in her right transverse venous sinus.[365] Her doctors had discovered the clot during a follow-up examination for a concussion she had sustained when she had fainted and fallen nearly three weeks earlier, after developing severe dehydration from a viral intestinal ailment acquired during a trip to Europe.[365][366] The clot, which caused no immediate neurological injury, was treated with anticoagulant medication, and her doctors subsequently said she made a full recovery.[366][367][nb 13]

Overall themes
Throughout her time in office, and in her final speech concluding it, Clinton viewed "smart power" as the strategy for asserting U.S. leadership and valuesâ€”in a world of varied threats, weakened central governments, and increasingly important nongovernmental entitiesâ€”by combining military hard power with diplomacy and U.S. soft power capacities in global economics, development aid, technology, creativity, and human rights advocacy.[346][371] As such, she became the first secretary of state to methodically implement the smart power approach.[372] In debates over use of military force, she was generally one of the more hawkish voices in the administration.[249][335][356] In August 2011 she hailed the ongoing multinational military intervention in Libya and the initial U.S. response towards the Syrian Civil War as examples of smart power in action.[373]

Clinton greatly expanded the State Department's use of social media, including Facebook and Twitter, both to get its message out and to help empower citizens of foreign countries vis-Ã -vis their governments.[346] And in the Mideast turmoil, Clinton particularly saw an opportunity to advance one of the central themes of her tenure, the empowerment and welfare of women and girls worldwide.[181] Moreover, in a formulation that became known as "the Hillary Doctrine", she viewed women's rights as critical for U.S. security interests, due to a link between the level of violence against women and gender inequality within a state and the instability and challenge to international security of that state.[333][374] In turn, there was a trend of women around the world finding more opportunities, and in some cases feeling safer, as the result of her actions and visibility.[375]

Clinton visited 112 countries during her tenure, making her the most widely traveled secretary of state[376][nb 14] (Time magazine wrote that "Clinton's endurance is legendary").[346] The first secretary of state to visit countries such as Togo and Timor-Leste, she believed that in-person visits were more important than ever in the virtual age.[379] As early as March 2011, she indicated she was not interested in serving a second term as Secretary of State should Obama be re-elected in 2012;[347] in December 2012, following that re-election, Obama nominated Senator John Kerry to be Clinton's successor.[366] Her last day as Secretary of State was February 1, 2013.[380] Upon her departure, analysts commented that Clinton's tenure did not bring any signature diplomatic breakthroughs as some other Secretaries of State had,[336][337] and highlighted her focus on goals that she thought were less tangible but would have more lasting effect.[381]

Benghazi attack and subsequent hearings

On September 11, 2012, the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, was attacked, resulting in the deaths of the U.S. Ambassador, J. Christopher Stevens, and three other Americans. The attack, questions surrounding the security of the U.S. consulate, and the varying explanations given afterward by administration officials for what had happened, became politically controversial in the U.S.[382] On October 15, Clinton took responsibility for the question of security lapses and said the differing explanations were due to the inevitable fog of war confusion after such events.[382][383]

On December 19, a panel led by Thomas R. Pickering and Michael Mullen issued its report on the matter. It was sharply critical of State Department officials in Washington for ignoring requests for more guards and safety upgrades and for failing to adapt security procedures to a deteriorating security environment.[384] It focused its criticism on the department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security and Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs; four State Department officials at the assistant secretary level and below were removed from their posts as a consequence.[385] Clinton said she accepted the conclusions of the report and that changes were underway to implement its suggested recommendations.[384]

Clinton gave testimony to two congressional foreign affairs committees on January 23, 2013, regarding the Benghazi attack. She defended her actions in response to the incident and, while still accepting formal responsibility, said she had had no direct role in specific discussions beforehand regarding consulate security.[386] Congressional Republicans challenged her on several points, to which she responded. In particular, after persistent questioning about whether the administration had issued inaccurate "talking points" after the attack, Clinton responded with the much-quoted rejoinder, "With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they'd they go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, Senator."[386][387] In November 2014, the House Intelligence Committee issued a report that concluded there had been no wrongdoing in the administration's response to the attack.[388]


Clinton testifying before the House Select Committee on Benghazi on October 22, 2015
The House Select Committee on Benghazi was created in May 2014 and has conducted lengthy investigations related to the 2012 attack. In response to an interviewer's question in September 2015 about what the Republicans had accomplished in Congress, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, credited the Benghazi hearings with lowering Clinton's poll numbers. McCarthy's answer contradicted the Republicans' previous talking points on the investigation. For example, outgoing Speaker of the House John Boehner had consistently expressed disgust at any suggestion that the hearings were politically motivated.[389] On October 22, 2015, Clinton testified at an all-day and nighttime session before the committee.[390][391] The hearing included many heated exchanges between committee members and Clinton, and between the committee members themselves.[390] Clinton was widely seen as emerging largely unscathed from the hearing, because of what the media perceived as a calm and unfazed demeanor, and a lengthy, meandering, repetitive line of questioning from the committee.[392]

Email controversy
Main article: Hillary Clinton email controversy
A controversy arose in March 2015, when it was revealed by the State Department's inspector general that Clinton had exclusively used personal email accounts on a non-government, privately maintained serverâ€”in lieu of email accounts maintained on federal government serversâ€”when conducting official business during her tenure as Secretary of State. Some experts, officials, members of Congress, and political opponents, contended that her use of private messaging system software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures, and federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping requirements.

Nearly 2,100 emails contained in Clinton's server were retroactively marked classified by the State Department, though none of the emails were marked classified at the time they were sent. 65 were later classified as "secret", more than 20 were designated "top secret", and the rest were later designated as "confidential".[393][394][395]

However, the intelligence community's inspector general wrote Congress to say that some of the emails "contained classified State Department information when originated."[396] In a joint statement released on July 15, 2015, the inspector general of the State Department and the inspector general of the intelligence community said that through their review of the emails, they found information that was classified when sent, remained so as of their inspection, and "never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system."[397] They also stated unequivocally that those secrets never should have been stored outside of secure government computer systems.[397] Mrs. Clinton had stated over a period of months that she kept no classified information on the private server that she set up in her house.[397]

Government policy, reiterated in the nondisclosure agreement signed by Clinton as part of gaining her security clearance, is that sensitive information can be considered as classified even if not marked as such.[398] After allegations were raised that some of the emails in question fell into the so-called "born classified" category, an FBI probe was initiated regarding how classified information was handled on the Clinton server.[399][400][401][402] In May 2016, the inspector general of the State Department criticized her use of a private email server while she was Secretary of State stating that she had not requested permission to use it and even if she had, she would not have been given permission.[403]

The controversy occurred against the backdrop of Clinton's 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the House Select Committee on Benghazi.[404][405]

In July 2016, the FBI issued a statement which described Clinton's mishandling of classified information as "extremely careless", but stated that it would not recommend criminal charges against Clinton over it.[406]

On April 12, 2015, Clinton formally announced her candidacy for the presidency in the 2016 election.[407] She had a campaign-in-waiting already in place, including a large donor network, experienced operatives, and the Ready for Hillary and Priorities USA Action political action committees, and other infrastructure.[408] The campaign's headquarters were established in the New York City borough of Brooklyn.[409] Focuses of her campaign have included raising middle class incomes, establishing universal preschool and making college more affordable, and improving the Affordable Care Act.[410][411] Initially considered a prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination,[407] Clinton has faced an unexpectedly strong challenge from self-professed democratic socialist Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose longtime stance against the influence of corporations and the wealthy in American politics has resonated with a dissatisfied citizenry troubled by the effects of income inequality in the U.S. and has contrasted with Clinton's Wall Street ties.[412][411]

In the initial contest of the primaries season, Clinton only very narrowly won the Iowa Democratic caucuses, held February 1, over an increasingly popular Sanders,[413][414] making her the first woman to win the Iowa caucuses.[413] In the first primary, held in New Hampshire on February 9, she lost to Sanders by a wide margin.[415] Sanders was an increasing threat in the next contest, the Nevada caucuses on February 20,[416] but Clinton managed a five-percentage-point win, aided by final-days campaigning among casino workers.[417] She followed that with a lopsided victory in the South Carolina primary on February 27.[416] These two victories stabilized her campaign and showed an avoidance of the management turmoil that harmed her 2008 effort.[416]

On the March 1 "Super Tuesday", Clinton won seven of eleven contests, including a string of dominating victories across the South buoyed, as in South Carolina, by African-American voters, and opened up a significant lead in pledged delegates over Sanders.[418] She maintained this delegate lead across subsequent contests during the primary season, with a consistent pattern throughout being that Sanders did better among younger, whiter, more rural, and more liberal voters and in states that held caucuses or where eligibility was open to independents, while Clinton did better among older and more diverse voter populations and in states that held primaries or where eligibility was restricted to registered Democrats.[419][420][421]

By June 6, 2016, she had earned enough pledged delegates and supportive superdelegates for the media to consider her the presumptive nominee.[422] The next day, after winning most of the states in the final major round of primaries, Clinton held a victory rally in Brooklyn in which she became the first woman to claim the status of presumptive nominee for a major American political party.[423] By campaign's end, Clinton had won 2,219 pledged delegates to Sanders' 1,832; with an estimated 594 superdelegates compared to Sanders' 47.[424] She received almost 17 million votes during the nominating process, as opposed to Sanders' 13 million.[425]

When Clinton left the State Department she became a private citizen for the first time in thirty years.[426] She and her daughter joined her husband as named members of the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation in 2013.[427] There she focused on early childhood development efforts, including an initiative called Too Small to Fail and a $600 million initiative to encourage the enrollment of girls in secondary schools worldwide, led by former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard.[427][428]

Clinton also led the No Ceilings: The Full Participation Project, a partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to gather and study data on the progress of women and girls around the world since the Beijing conference in 1995;[429] its March 2015 report said that while "There has never been a better time in history to be born a woman ... this data shows just how far we still have to go."[430] The foundation began accepting new donations from foreign governments, which it had stopped doing while she was secretary.[nb 15]

She began work on another volume of memoirs, and made appearances on the paid speaking circuit.[433] There she received $200,000â€“225,000 per engagement, often appearing before Wall Street firms or at business conventions.[433][412] She also made some unpaid speeches on behalf of the foundation.[433] For the fifteen months ending in March 2015, Clinton earned over $11 million from her speeches.[434] For the overall period 2007â€“14, the Clintons earned almost $141 million, paid some $56 million in federal and state taxes, and donated about $15 million to charity.[435] As of 2015, she was estimated to be worth over $30 million on her own, or $45â€“53 million with her husband.[436]

Clinton resigned from the foundation's board in April 2015, when she began her presidential campaign, and the foundation said it would accept new foreign governmental donations from six Western nations only.[nb 15]

Several organizations have attempted to measure Clinton's place on the political spectrum scientifically using her Senate votes. National Journal's 2004 study of roll-call votes assigned Clinton a rating of 30 in the political spectrum, relative to the Senate at the time, with a rating of 1 being most liberal and 100 being most conservative.[437] National Journal's subsequent rankings placed her as the 32nd-most liberal senator in 2006 and 16th-most liberal senator in 2007.[438] A 2004 analysis by political scientists Joshua D. Clinton of Princeton University and Simon Jackman and Doug Rivers of Stanford University found her to be likely the sixth-to-eighth-most liberal senator.[439] The Almanac of American Politics, edited by Michael Barone and Richard E. Cohen, rated her votes from 2003 through 2006 as liberal or conservative, with 100 as the highest rating, in three areas: Economic, Social, and Foreign. Averaged for the four years, the ratings are: Economic = 75 liberal, 23 conservative; Social = 83 liberal, 6 conservative; Foreign = 66 liberal, 30 conservative. Total average = 75 liberal, 20 conservative.[nb 16]

Organizations have also attempted to give newer assessments of Clinton once she reentered elective politics in 2015. Based on her stated positions from the 1990s to the present, On the Issues places her in their "Left Liberal" region on their two-dimensional grid of social and economic ideologies, with a social score of 80 on a scale of 0 more-restrictive to 100 less-government stances and an economic score of 10 on a scale of 0 more-restrictive to 100 less-government stances.[440] Crowdpac, which does a data aggregation of campaign contributions, votes, and speeches, gives her a 6.5L rating on a one-dimensional left-right scale from 10L (most liberal) to 10C (most conservative).[441]

Interest groups also gave Clinton scores based on how well her Senate votes aligned with the positions of the group. Through 2008, she had an average lifetime 90 percent "Liberal Quotient" from Americans for Democratic Action,[442] and a lifetime 8 percent rating from the American Conservative Union.[443]

In a Gallup poll conducted during May 2005, 54 percent of respondents considered Clinton a liberal, 30 percent considered her a moderate, and 9 percent considered her a conservative.[444]

As First Lady of the United States, Clinton published a weekly syndicated newspaper column titled "Talking It Over" from 1995 to 2000.[445] It focused on her experiences and those of women, children, and families she met during her travels around the world.[2]

In 1996, Clinton presented a vision for the children of America in the book It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us. The book made the Best Seller list of The New York Times and Clinton received the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in 1997 for the book's audio recording.[446]

Other books published by Clinton when she was first lady include Dear Socks, Dear Buddy: Kids' Letters to the First Pets (1998) and An Invitation to the White House: At Home with History (2000). In 2001, she wrote an afterword to the children's book Beatrice's Goat.[447]

In 2003, Clinton released a 562-page autobiography, Living History, for which publisher Simon & Schuster paid Clinton a near-record advance of $8 million.[448] The book set a first-week sales record for a nonfiction work,[449] went on to sell more than one million copies in the first month following publication,[450] and was translated into twelve foreign languages.[451] Clinton's audio recording of the book earned her a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album.[452]

In 2014, Clinton published a second memoir, Hard Choices, which focused on her time as Secretary of State. It has sold about 250,000 copies.[453]

Cultural and political image
Over a hundred books and scholarly works have been written about Hillary Rodham Clinton, from many perspectives. A 2006 survey by the New York Observer found "a virtual cottage industry" of "anti-Clinton literature",[454] put out by Regnery Publishing and other conservative imprints,[454] with titles such as Madame Hillary: The Dark Road to the White House, Hillary's Scheme: Inside the Next Clinton's Ruthless Agenda to Take the White House, and Can She Be Stopped?: Hillary Clinton Will Be the Next President of the United States Unless ... Books praising Clinton did not sell nearly as well[454] (other than the memoirs written by her and her husband). When she ran for Senate in 2000, a number of fundraising groups such as Save Our Senate and the Emergency Committee to Stop Hillary Rodham Clinton sprang up to oppose her.[455] Van Natta found that Republican and conservative groups viewed her as a reliable "bogeyman" to mention in fundraising letters,[456] on a par with Ted Kennedy, and the equivalent of Democratic and liberal appeals mentioning Newt Gingrich.[456]

Hillary Clinton has also been featured in the media and popular culture from a wide spectrum of varying perspectives. In 1995, writer Todd S. Purdum of The New York Times characterized Clinton as a Rorschach test,[457] an assessment echoed at the time by feminist writer and activist Betty Friedan, who said, "Coverage of Hillary Clinton is a massive Rorschach test of the evolution of women in our society."[458] She has been the subject of many satirical impressions on Saturday Night Live, beginning with her time as first lady, and has made guest appearances on the show herself, in 2008 and in 2015, to face-off with her doppelgÃ¤ngers.[459][460]

Three-story, red brick building
Clinton worked at Rose Law Firm for fifteen years. Her professional career and political involvement set the stage for public reaction to her as first lady.
Clinton has often been described in the popular media as a polarizing figure, with some arguing otherwise.[461] James Madison University political science professor Valerie Sulfaro's 2007 study used the American National Election Studies' "feeling thermometer" polls, which measure the degree of opinion about a political figure, to find that such polls during Clinton's first lady years confirm the "conventional wisdom that Hillary Clinton is a polarizing figure", with the added insight that "affect towards Mrs. Clinton as first lady tended to be very positive or very negative, with a fairly constant one fourth of respondents feeling ambivalent or neutral".[462] University of California, San Diego political science professor Gary Jacobson's 2006 study of partisan polarization found that in a state-by-state survey of job approval ratings of the state's senators, Clinton had the fourth-largest partisan difference of any senator, with a 50-percentage-point difference in approval between New York's Democrats and Republicans.[463]

Northern Illinois University political science professor Barbara Burrell's 2000 study found that Clinton's Gallup poll favorability numbers broke sharply along partisan lines throughout her time as first lady, with 70 to 90 percent of Democrats typically viewing her favorably while only 20 to 40 percent of Republicans did.[464] University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison political science professor Charles Franklin analyzed her record of favorable versus unfavorable ratings in public opinion polls, and found that there was more variation in them during her first lady years than her Senate years.[465] The Senate years showed favorable ratings around 50 percent and unfavorable ratings in the mid-40 percent range; Franklin noted that, "This sharp split is, of course, one of the more widely remarked aspects of Sen. Clinton's public image."[465] McGill University professor of history Gil Troy titled his 2006 biography of her Hillary Rodham Clinton: Polarizing First Lady, and wrote that after the 1992 campaign, Clinton "was a polarizing figure, with 42 percent [of the public] saying she came closer to their values and lifestyle than previous first ladies and 41 percent disagreeing."[466] Troy further wrote that Hillary Clinton "has been uniquely controversial and contradictory since she first appeared on the national radar screen in 1992"[467] and that she "has alternately fascinated, bedeviled, bewitched, and appalled Americans."[467]

Line chart
Hillary Rodham Clinton's Gallup Poll favorable and unfavorable ratings, 1992â€“2016.[468] The ratings show her as a controversial first lady whose ratings hit a low following the Hillarycare failure and a high following the Lewinsky scandal. Opinion about her was closely divided during her 2000 Senate campaign, mildly positive during her time as a senator, and then closely divided again during her 2008 presidential campaign. As secretary of state, she enjoyed widespread approval, before dipping as her tenure ended and then to some of her lowest ratings ever as she became viewed as a presidential candidate again.[469]
Burrell's study found women consistently rating Clinton more favorably than men by about ten percentage points during her first lady years.[464] Jacobson's study found a positive correlation across all senators between being women and receiving a partisan-polarized response.[463] Colorado State University communication studies professor Karrin Vasby Anderson describes the first lady position as a "site" for American womanhood, one ready made for the symbolic negotiation of female identity.[470] In particular, Anderson states there has been a cultural bias towards traditional first ladies and a cultural prohibition against modern first ladies; by the time of Clinton, the first lady position had become a site of heterogeneity and paradox.[470] Burrell, as well as biographers Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta Jr., note that Clinton achieved her highest approval ratings as first lady late in 1998, not for professional or political achievements of her own, but for being seen as the victim of her husband's very public infidelity.[212][464] University of Pennsylvania communications professor Kathleen Hall Jamieson saw Hillary Clinton as an exemplar of the double bind, who though able to live in a "both-and" world of both career and family, nevertheless "became a surrogate on whom we projected our attitudes about attributes once thought incompatible", leading to her being placed in a variety of no-win situations.[458] Quinnipiac University media studies professor Lisa Burns found press accounts frequently framing Clinton both as an exemplar of the modern professional working mother and as a political interloper interested in usurping power for herself.[471] University of Indianapolis English professor Charlotte Templin found political cartoonists using a variety of stereotypesâ€”such as gender reversal, radical feminist as emasculator, and the wife the husband wants to get rid ofâ€”to portray Hillary Clinton as violating gender norms.[472]

Going into the early stages of her presidential campaign for 2008, a Time magazine cover showed a large picture of her, with two checkboxes labeled "Love Her", "Hate Her",[473] while Mother Jones titled its profile of her "Harpy, Hero, Heretic: Hillary".[474] Democratic netroots activists consistently rated Clinton very low in polls of their desired candidates,[475] while some conservative figures such as Bruce Bartlett and Christopher Ruddy were declaring a Hillary Clinton presidency not so bad after all.[476][477] An October 2007 cover of The American Conservative magazine was titled "The Waning Power of Hillary Hate".[478] By December 2007, communications professor Jamieson observed that there was a large amount of misogyny present about Clinton on the Internet,[479] up to and including Facebook and other sites devoted to depictions reducing Clinton to sexual humiliation.[479] She noted, in response to widespread comments on Clinton's laugh,[480] that "We know that there's language to condemn female speech that doesn't exist for male speech. We call women's speech shrill and strident. And Hillary Clinton's laugh was being described as a cackle."[479] The "bitch" epithet, which had been applied to Clinton going back to her first lady days and had been seen by Karrin Vasby Anderson as a tool of containment against women in American politics,[481] flourished during the campaign, especially on the Internet but via conventional media as well.[482] Following Clinton's "choked up moment" and related incidents in the run-up to the January 2008 New Hampshire primary, both The New York Times and Newsweek found that discussion of gender's role in the campaign had moved into the national political discourse.[483][484] Newsweek editor Jon Meacham summed the relationship between Clinton and the American public by saying that the New Hampshire events "brought an odd truth to light: though Hillary Rodham Clinton has been on the periphery or in the middle of national life for decades ... she is one of the most recognizable but least understood figures in American politics."[484]


Clinton in 2015
Once she became Secretary of State, Clinton's image seemed to improve dramatically among the American public and become one of a respected world figure.[333][485] She gained consistently high approval ratings (by 2011, the highest of her career except during the Lewinsky scandal),[486] and her favorable-unfavorable ratings during 2010 and 2011 were the highest of any active, nationally prominent American political figure.[485][487] A 2012 Internet meme, "Texts from Hillary", was based around a photograph of Clinton sitting on a military plane wearing sunglasses and using a mobile phone and imagined the recipients and contents of her text messages. It achieved viral popularity among younger, technically adept followers of politics.[488] Clinton sought to explain her popularity by saying in early 2012, "There's a certain consistency to who I am and what I do, and I think people have finally said, 'Well, you know, I kinda get her now.'"[333] She continued to do well in Gallup's most admired man and woman poll and in 2015 she was named the most admired woman by Americans for a record fourteenth straight time and twentieth time overall.[489]

Her favorability ratings dropped, however, after she left office and began to be viewed in the context of partisan politics again.[490] By September 2015, with her 2016 presidential campaign underway and beset by continued reports regarding her private email usage at the State Department, her ratings had slumped to the some of her lowest levels ever.[491] During 2016 she acknowledged that: "I'm not a natural politician, in case you haven't noticed."[492][493] Journalist Indira A. R. Lakshmanan, who has covered Clinton extensively both as a presidential candidate and as secretary of state, believes that Clinton's persona is almost completely different in the two roles and that while Clinton definitely has the political skills that an officeholder needs, "Clearly, however, something seems to happen to Clinton when the task is asking people to vote for her."[493]
