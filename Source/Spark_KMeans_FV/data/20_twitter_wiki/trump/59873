Family
Trump has had three marriages, the first two ending in divorce, which have been publicized in the tabloid media.[393] His personal life has also gained extensive coverage in the mainstream media.[394]

Trump married his first wife, Czech model Ivana Zelníčková, at age 30 on April 7, 1977 at the Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan.[395] They had three children: sons Donald, Jr. (born December 31, 1977) and Eric (born January 6, 1984) and daughter Ivanka (born October 30, 1981). Donald Jr., Eric, and Ivanka now serve as executive vice presidents of The Trump Organization.[396]

Ivana became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1988, with Trump at her side.[397] Trump is popularly known as "The Donald", a nickname perpetuated by the media after Ivana referred to him as such in a 1989 Spy magazine cover story.[398][399] By early 1990, Trump's troubled marriage to Ivana and long-running affair with actress Marla Maples had become fodder for the tabloid press.[15][400] The couple divorced in 1991; then in October of that year his mother was mugged, and in November he helped a stranger who was being mugged.[401][402] In 1992, he sued Ivana for not honoring a gag clause in their divorce agreement by disclosing facts about him in her best-selling book, and Trump won a gag order.[403][404][405] In 2015, Ivana said that she and Donald "are the best of friends".[406]

Maples gave birth to their daughter Tiffany on October 13, 1993. They married two months later on December 20, 1993.[407] The couple formally separated in May 1997,[408] with their divorce finalized in June 1999.[409][410]


Trump's wife Melania at a campaign event in 2016
In 1998, Trump began a relationship with Slovenian-born fashion model Melania Knauss.[411][412] They became engaged in April 2004[413] and were married on January 22, 2005 at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church, on the island of Palm Beach, Florida, followed by a reception at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate.[414][415][416] In 2006, Melania became a naturalized U.S. citizen.[412] In March 2006, she gave birth to their son whom they named Barron William Trump.[417][418] (Trump had previously used the pseudonym "John Baron" or "Barron" in some business deals and for other purposes.[13][51][419][420]) Having spoken the language since his childhood, Barron is fluent in Slovenian.[421] In a February 2009 interview on ABC's news program Nightline, Trump commented that his love for his business had made it difficult for his first two wives to compete with his affection for work.[422]

Trump has eight grandchildren: five via his son Donald Jr.,[423][424][425] and three via his daughter Ivanka.[426][427][428]

His brother Fred Jr. predeceased his father Fred, and, shortly after the latter died in 1999, Fred III's wife gave birth to a son with serious medical problems. Trump and his family offered to pay the medical bills through Fred Sr.'s company (Fred Sr. freely provided medical coverage to his family through his company for decades).[429] Fred III then sued the family for allegedly having used "undue influence" on a dementia-stricken Fred Sr. to get Fred III and his sister Mary a reduced share from their grandfather's will, but Trump attributed the reduced share to his father's dislike of Fred III's mother, and Trump stopped the aid for Fred III's son. The aid was resumed by court order pending outcome of the lawsuit, which was then settled.[430][431]

Religious views
Trump is a Presbyterian.[432] Trump said he began going to church at the First Presbyterian Church in the Jamaica neighborhood in Queens, when he was younger.[clarification needed][433] Trump attended Sunday school and had his confirmation at that church.[433]

In an April 2011 interview on the 700 Club, he commented: "I'm a Protestant, I'm a Presbyterian. And you know I've had a good relationship with the church over the years. I think religion is a wonderful thing. I think my religion is a wonderful religion."[434][435] Trump told a 2015 South Carolina campaign audience he attends Marble Collegiate Church, where he married his first wife Ivana in 1977. Marble has said that, though Trump has a longstanding history with the church, he is a Presbyterian and not an active member of Marble.[433] Trump has said that although he participates in Holy Communion, he has not asked God for forgiveness for his sins. He stated, "I think if I do something wrong, I think, I just try and make it right. I don't bring God into that picture."[436]

In 1983, the Reverend Norman Vincent Peale, described in a New York Times profile as Trump's "pastor" and "family minister", said that Trump was "kindly and courteous in certain business negotiations and has a profound streak of honest humility."[21] Trump calls his own book The Art of the Deal (1987) "my second favorite book of all time," and has told campaign audiences: "Do you know what my first is? The Bible! Nothing beats the Bible."[437][438] Declining to name his favorite Bible verse, Trump said "I don't like giving that out to people that you hardly know."[433]

Trump maintains relationships with several prominent national Evangelical Protestant and other Christian leaders, including Tony Perkins and Ralph Reed.[439] During his 2016 presidential campaign, he received a blessing from Greek Orthodox priest Emmanuel Lemelson.[440]

Trump has ties to the Jewish-American community.[441] At an Algemeiner Journal awards ceremony honoring him with the Algemeiner Liberty Award, he was asked about having Jewish grandchildren. In reference to daughter Ivanka, who converted to Judaism before her marriage to Jared Kushner, Trump said: "Not only do I have Jewish grandchildren, I have a Jewish daughter; and I am very honored by that ... it wasn't in the plan but I am very glad it happened."[442]

Controversy involving the Pope
In February 2016, while on his way home following a visit to Mexico, Pope Francis said the following:[443][444]

A person who thinks only about building walls—wherever they may be—and not building bridges, is not Christian. ...I'd just say that this man [Trump] is not Christian if he said it this way. ...We must see if he said things in that way and in this I give the benefit of the doubt.

Trump responded that it was "disgraceful" for the Pope to question his faith, and suggested that the Mexican government was "using the Pope as a pawn" for political purposes, "because they want to continue to rip off the United States."[445][446][447] Trump said that "if and when" the Islamic State (ISIL) attacks the Vatican, the Pope would have "wished and prayed" Trump were President because under Trump's leadership, such an attack would not happen.[446][447]

Shortly thereafter, Director of the Holy See Press Office Federico Lombardi insisted that the Pope was "in no way" launching an attack on Donald Trump nor was he trying to sway voters by declaring someone who advocates building walls isn't Christian.[448] The spokesman said that "the Pope has made it clear that he would not enter into the [presidential] election campaign in the United States", and indeed the headlines in the United States had gone considerably beyond what the Pope had actually said.[449] After the clarification by Lombardi, Trump retracted his criticism of the Pope: "I don't think this is a fight," said Trump. "I think he said something much softer than was originally reported by the media."[450]

Other personal information
Trump has never done drugs, or smoked cigarettes, and has always heeded a warning from his older brother (an alcoholic) to not drink alcohol.[451][452][453] He also has germaphobic tendencies, and therefore prefers not to shake hands.[454]

On The Howard Stern Show in 1997, Trump discussed with Stern the risk of getting diseases from dating, and agreed with Stern's characterization of dating as Trump's "personal Vietnam".[455][456] Trump said he felt "like a great and very brave soldier", but added, "This is better than Vietnam".[455][457]

Trump has hinted about "experiences" with married women.[458] He was rumored to have dated models such as Carla Bruni in the early 1990s[459][460] and Kara Young in the mid to late 1990s[461]—although Bruni denied the rumors, stating that she had met Trump only once.[462] He allegedly "bombarded" Princess Diana with expensive flowers after her 1996 divorce from Prince Charles,[463] and has said that he would have liked to have courted that "genuine princess".[464] He sometimes gave the impression that Diana and/or Charles had an interest in his properties, which they apparently did not.[419][465]

In an interview with director Errol Morris in 2002, Trump told him that Citizen Kane was his favorite movie. In his personal analysis of the film, Trump believes that the message of the film is that "wealth isn't everything...because [Kane] had the wealth, but he didn't have happiness." Furthermore, Trump explained his meaning of the dinner table scene: "The table [keeps] getting larger and larger and larger, with [Kane] and his wife getting further and further apart as he got wealthier and wealthier....perhaps, I can understand that."[466]

Appearances in popular culture
Prior to 2015
Even before Trump's very highly publicized presidential campaign that began in 2015, he often appeared in popular culture. Trump has been depicted in the Doonesbury comic strip by Garry Trudeau since 1987.[467][468] The depictions prompted an unfavorable response from Trump.[469][470]

Trump and members of his family have been parodied on Saturday Night Live since 1988, and he has hosted the show twice, in April 2004 and November 2015.[471] The 2015 episode had the highest ratings of a Saturday Night Live episode since December 21, 2013.[472]

You've Been Trumped, a 2011 documentary film by Anthony Baxter, follows the development of a Scottish golf resort.[146][473][474][475][476][477] When it was announced that the documentary was to be given its UK television première on BBC Two on October 21, 2012,[478] Trump's lawyers contacted the BBC to demand that the film should not be shown, claiming it was defamatory and misleading. The screening went ahead, with the BBC defending the decision and stating that Trump had refused the opportunity to take part in the film.[479]

In 2011, the rapper Mac Miller released a song named after Trump, about becoming as rich as him. Trump requested royalties from the song for using his name, starting a feud between himself and Miller.[480]

During and after 2015
On February 10, 2016, Funny or Die released a parody film called Donald Trump's The Art of the Deal: The Movie.[481]

On The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Stephen Colbert would frequently feature a caricature of Trump called "Cartoon Donald Trump". Colbert's reasoning for including a cartoon version of Trump is because he felt like that Trump had resorted to "almost cartoonish tactics".[482] Meanwhile, on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Jimmy Kimmel wrote two Dr. Seuss-like books: "Winners aren't Losers" and its sequel "Winners Still Aren't Losers". Both of these books were featured when Trump was the guest star. On the show, Kimmel would read it out loud to Trump, having Trump read the last word on both occasions.[483][484]

Over the course of his career, Trump has been involved in a number of lawsuits beyond those already mentioned, including over 150 lawsuits in US federal courts and over 150 lawsuits in Broward County Court (in Florida) since 1983.[485][486][487] Some of the lawsuits have been initiated by Trump as plaintiff, and others have been initiated by others against him as defendant. Particularly in the real estate industry, litigation is common for enforcing contracts and resolving business disputes, though Trump's opponents have said his litigiousness is not a trait that conservatives should support.[488][489]

Trump as plaintiff or defendant
In the 1980s, Trump was sued for allegedly trying to force out tenants to enable demolition,[490] but the matter was settled and the demolition cancelled.[491] In 1988, Trump paid $750,000 to settle the civil penalties in an antitrust lawsuit stemming from stock purchases.[492]

In the 1990s, a business analyst predicted that the Taj Mahal would soon fail, and he then lost his job; the analyst sued Trump for allegedly having an unlawful role in the firing, and that matter was settled confidentially out of court.[493] After a helicopter crashed, killing three executives of his New Jersey hotel casino business, Trump sued the manufacturers,[494] and that case was dismissed.[495] Trump Plaza was fined $200,000 for moving African-American and female employees away from a racist and sexist gambler to accommodate him, but Trump was not evidently investigated, nor held personally liable, and said he would not even recognize that gambler.[496] Also during that decade, Trump's father, Fred Trump, made an unlawful loan to Trump's Castle to help it make a mortgage payment, and the casino was required to pay a $30,000 fine, but his son was not penalized.[497]

Also in the 1990s, Trump sued business partner Jay Pritzker for allegedly collecting excessive fees, and the matter was settled.[498][499][500] Boarding house owner Vera Coking sued for damage during construction of an adjacent casino, and later dropped the suit against Trump while settling with his contractor; she also prevailed against Trump and other developers in an eminent domain case.[501][502][503] In the late 1990s, Donald Trump and rival Atlantic City casino owner Stephen Wynn engaged in an extended legal conflict during the planning phase of new casinos Wynn had proposed to build, and the cases were ultimately settled.[504][505][506]

When one of his companies was charged by the SEC with poor financial reporting, Trump's attorney said the culprit had been dismissed, and that Trump had personally been unaware of the matter.[510][511][512] Following litigation with Leona Helmsley that started in the 1990s regarding control of the Empire State Building,[513][514] Trump in 2002 sold his share in that building to rivals of Helmsley.[515][516]

Also in the 2000s, Trump sued former business partner Richard Fields for allegedly saying he still consulted for Trump, Fields counter-sued,[517][518][519][520][521] and the lawsuit was ultimately dismissed.[522] The town of Palm Beach fined Trump for building an 80-foot (24-meter) pole for the American flag at his Mar-a-Lago property, Trump then sued, and a settlement required Trump to donate $100,000 to veterans' charities, while the town agreed to let Trump enroll out-of-towners in his social club, and permitted a 10-foot shorter flagpole elsewhere on his lawn.[523] When the California city of Rancho Palos Verdes thwarted luxury home development on a landslide-prone area owned by Trump, he sued,[524][524] and the city agreed to permit extensions for some 20 more proposed luxury homes.[525][526] Trump sued a law firm he had used, Morrison Cohen, for using his name, for providing news links at its website, and for charging excessive fees,[110] after which the firm halved the fees, and the court ruled that the links were allowable.[527] And, in the late 2000s, Trump was sued by investors in the canceled Trump Ocean Resort Baja Mexico;[528] Trump said he had merely been a spokesperson,[528][529] and he settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount.[530]


Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago
In the 2010s, the Trump Organization licensed a hotel and condo project in Fort Lauderdale, but the bursting of the real estate bubble led Trump to dissolve the deal, after which the project defaulted, investors sued,[531] and Trump was caught in the ongoing lawsuits because he had participated in advertising.[135][532] Trump personally guaranteed $40 million to secure a $640 million loan for Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago, and when Deutsche Bank tried to collect it, Trump sued the bank for harming the project and his reputation,[533] and the bank then agreed to extend the loan term by five years.[534] The Supreme Court of Scotland rejected Trump's suits against the nation of Scotland, in which Trump had alleged that the country was illegally building a wind farm near his golf course and planned hotel.[535][536]

Also in the 2010s, Trump sued the former Miss Pennsylvania Sheena Monnin after she alleged that the Miss USA 2012 pageant was rigged,[537] and a federal judge upheld the settlement obliging her to pay Trump $5 million.[537][538][539] Trump sued Palm Beach County for pressuring the FAA to direct air traffic over his home.[540] He also sued chefs Geoffrey Zakarian and José Andrés, the latter saying there was no merit in Trump's allegation that he backed out of a deal at the Old Post Office Pavilion.[541][542][543][544] Trump sued the town of Ossining, New York over the property tax valuation on his golf course there,[545][545][546] after separately being sued for modifying a drainage system that allegedly damaged a library, public pool, and park facilities.[546] In connection with a Trump presidential campaign event at Trump Tower in New York City, five men sued Trump whose security staff allegedly punched one of them.[547][548] Deborah Garcia, a restaurant worker at Trump SoHo, claims that Trump illegally withheld tips from employees, while the Trump Organization advises her to instead sue their alleged employer, a third-party contractor.[549]

Alleged links to organized crime
Journalists David Cay Johnston and Wayne Barrett, the latter of whom wrote an unauthorized 1992 Trump biography, have claimed that Trump and his companies did business with New York and Philadelphia families linked to the Italian-American Mafia.[550][551] A reporter for the Washington Post writes, "he was never accused of illegality, and observers of the time say that working with the mob-related figures and politicos came with the territory."[552]

Campaign contributions
According to a New York state report, Trump circumvented corporate and personal campaign donation limits in the 1980s—although no laws were broken—by donating money to candidates from 18 different business subsidiaries, rather than donating primarily in his own name.[552][553] Trump told investigators he did so on the advice of his lawyers. He also said the contributions were not to curry favor with business-friendly candidates, but simply to satisfy requests from friends.[552][554]
